<H3>&dollar;380,415</H3> 
<p class="white-background"> This is an immaculate two story house featuring 3500 square feet &comma; 4 bedrooms &comma; 
    and 3 and a half bathrooms. I spent 10 years of my life in this house. Located in the heart 
    of Seven Pines subdivision &comma; many memories were made at the pool and the generous 
    common are attached to the backyard!</p>

<H2>567 Heather Ridge Manor Court&comma; Wentzville&comma; MO&comma; 63385</H2>
<H3>&dollar;487,830</H3>
<p class="white-background"> This beautiful custom built home featured above was the second house that I lived in to 
    closeout my school years of childhood. Featuring 5 bedrooms and 5 bathrooms, this was 
    home for 10 more years! The move out of the St. Louis county to the end of St. Charles 
    County was unexpected, but easy to call home!</p>

        bedrooms&comma; 4 bathrooms&comma; and just under 3000 square feet, another short lived stop! Not much time 
        was spent at this location, as I was in college and spent mst of my time with my fiance!</p>

<H3>&dollar;212,058</H3>
<p id = "current" class="navy-background">The final and current stop on the journey of residences in my short life ends back in O Fallon. Much more quaint 
    and easier to mantain with 3 bedrooms&comma; 2 bathrooms&comma; and just under 1300 square feet&comma; this was 
    the first home purchased by myself! This will always be the most important residence&comma; because it is the 
    home that I started my family in.</p>
